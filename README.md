# SURVEY-FORM
in this survey form i just created a page in which all the three pages part are written in three different div ,
so for creating three different pages i just uses the display property of css .
with the help of css i just hide two`s of div`s and show only one div.
with the help of javascript i just update the show and hide property while click on next or prev button.
